# Using yFiles for HTML for More Demanding Use Cases

Integrating *yFiles Layout Algorithms for React Flow* offers a powerful toolkit to enhance *React Flow* projects
with advanced features. With precise node placement, sophisticated edge routing (including support for polyline
edges with bends), flexible node and edge label placement, and precise port positioning, developers can create visually
appealing graph layouts that help users quickly gain insights into complex data.

*yFiles Layout Algorithms for React Flow* leverages the robust layout features of [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html), a commercial
programming library designed for visualizing graphs, networks, and diagrams. In addition to layout algorithms,
yFiles for HTML also provides developers with high-performance diagramming visualizations and rich user interactions.

For projects with complex graph structures and demanding [use cases](https://www.yworks.com/use-cases), yFiles for HTML offers a compelling
alternative solution.
