![Welcome playground](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yWorks/yfiles-layout-reactflow/main/assets/yfiles-layouts-react-flow-hero-image.png)

Welcome to the *yFiles Layout Algorithms for React Flow* module, a powerful and versatile layout add-on for React Flow based on the [yFiles](https://www.yworks.com/yfiles-overview) library.

*yFiles Layout Algorithms for React Flow* is a comprehensive npm module designed to seamlessly integrate the powerful layout
capabilities of yFiles for HTML into React Flow.

With *yFiles Layout Algorithms for React Flow*, developers can utilize the advanced
graph layout algorithms and customization options provided by [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles)
within their React Flow projects, enabling precise control over the arrangement and appearance of nodes and edges.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To use the module, [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) is required.
You can evaluate yFiles for 60 days free of charge on [my.yworks.com](https://my.yworks.com/signup?product=YFILES_HTML_EVAL).
See [Licensing](https://www.yworks.com/docs/yfiles-react/process-mining-doc/introduction/licensing) for more information on this topic.

You can learn how to work with the yFiles npm module in our [Developerâ€™s Guide](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/yfiles_npm_module). A convenient way of getting access
to yFiles is to use the [yFiles Dev Suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yfiles-dev-suite).

## Project Setup

1. **Installation**

   In addition to yFiles, the module requires React to be installed in your project. If you want to start your project
   from scratch, we recommend using vite:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-yfiles-layout-app -- --template react-ts
   ```

   Install the ReactFlow:
   ```bash
   npm install reactflow
   ```

   Add the yFiles dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install <yFiles package path>/lib-dev/yfiles-26.0.0+dev.tgz
   ```

   <details>

   <summary>Sample <code>package.json</code> dependencies</summary>
   The resulting package.json dependencies should resemble the following:

   ```json
      dependencies: {
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
        "reactflow": "^11.11.0",
        "yfiles": "./lib-dev/yfiles-26.0.0.tgz"
     }
   ```
   </details>

   Install the module via npm by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install @yworks/yfiles-layout-reactflow
   ```

2. **License:**

   Be sure to invoke `registerLicense` function before using the module.
   When evaluating yFiles, the license JSON file is found in the `lib/` folder of the yFiles for HTML evaluation package.
   For licensed users, the license data is provided separately.

   <details>

       <summary>License registration</summary>

       Import or paste your license data and register the license, e.g. in `App.tsx`:

       ```js
       import yFilesLicense from './license.json'

       registerLicense(yFilesLicense)
       ```
   </details>

3. **Usage**

   Utilize the `useLayout`-hook in your React Flow application. First invoke `registerLicense` somewhere in your application.

   ```tsx
   // App.tsx
   import { registerLicense } from '@yworks/yfiles-layout-reactflow'
   import yFilesLicense from './license.json'
   
   function App() {
     registerLicense(yFilesLicense)
     return <Flow></Flow>
   }
    
   export default App
   ```
   Then create a custom flow with a layout button.

   ```tsx
   // Flow.tsx
   import { useCallback } from 'react'
   import ReactFlow, {
     addEdge,
     Connection,
     EdgeProps,
     NodeProps,
     Panel,
     ReactFlowProvider,
     useEdgesState,
     useNodesState
   } from 'reactflow'
   import 'reactflow/dist/style.css'
   import { MultiHandleNode, PolylineEdge, useLayout } from '@yworks/yfiles-layout-reactflow'
   
   import initialNodes from './nodes.json'
   import initialEdges from './edges.json'
   
   // use the node and edge types that can process the layout result
   // including multiple handles and bends in edges
   const edgeTypes = {
     default: PolylineEdge
   }
   const nodeTypes = {
     default: MultiHandleNode
   }

   function LayoutFlow() {
     const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
     const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

     const onConnect = useCallback(
       (connection:Connection) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(connection, eds)),
       [setEdges]
     )
   
     // use the layout-hook to configure the layout algorithm
     const { runLayout } = useLayout()
   
     return (
       <ReactFlow
         nodes={nodes}
         edges={edges}
         onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
         onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
         onConnect={onConnect}
         nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
         edgeTypes={edgeTypes}
       >
         <Panel position="top-left">
           <button onClick={() => runLayout('HierarchicLayout')}>Run Layout</button>
         </Panel>
       </ReactFlow>
     );
   }
   
   export default function Flow() {
     return (
       <ReactFlowProvider>
         <LayoutFlow />
       </ReactFlowProvider>
     )
   }

   ```

   > Note that in order to effectively visualize the outcome of the layout algorithm, it is essential to use Node and Edge types that are capable of accommodating multiple handles and polyline paths.
